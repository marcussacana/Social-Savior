# Social Savior
### A tool that can Save Your Social-Life

This Software is a Universal Panic Button tool, Aiming to prevent others from finding out what you are doing on your computer.

Social Savior was designed to be as discrete as possible, so it includes a fake initial window to stop curious people from trying to mess around with it.
